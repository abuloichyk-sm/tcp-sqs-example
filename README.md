You need to include AWS config file for SQS

Windows:	C:\Users\<yourUserName>\.aws\credentials
Linux, macOS, or Unix: ~/.aws/credentials

Important
Don't include a file extension when saving the credentials file.

Credentials file example (all 3 lines):
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
